Demonspawn : a benchmark / santity test / stress test tool.

Victor Eijkhout 2020

Demonspawn is a tool that makes it easy to fire up lots of tests at once.
This can be used 
- as a benchmarking tool for kernels / micro-apps
- as a stress test doing parametrized runs of a single test
- sanity test: after a system upgrade, see if everything still works.

Usage:

python3 batch.py -c configuration_file

where the configuration file specfies job parameters and the specification of what is to be run.
Example:

system frontera
user eijkhout
account A-ccsc
modules intel/18.0.2 impi/18.0.2
let rootdir = /your/dir/ectory
scriptdir %[rootdir]/paw.scripts
outputdir %[rootdir]/paw.output
nodes 4
suite name:paw-mpi type:mpi dir:/work/00434/eijkhout/paw/installation p2p_*

The following fields are defined:

system : enforce the system on which a configuration can be run
user : not used
account: slurm identification of the account that the parallel run is charged to.
modules: to be loaded at the start of the job. It is assumed that the testsuite
    is compiled with these modules.
scriptdir : temporary directory where slurm scripts will go.
outputdir : directory from which the slurm jobs are launched, and which,
    most likely, will wind up containing generated output.
nodes : node count for the testsuite, unless the suite itself overrides this.
    node count value can also be a colon-separated list, for scalability studies.

suite : list of key:value pairs, followed by a list of programs
keys:
  name : for identification purposes
  type : mpi jobs are started with ibrun
  dir  : location of the programs
programs : specified with wildcards but no path; all programs are assumed to be
    in the "dir" value.
